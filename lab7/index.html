            <h2>A piece about me</h2>
            <a>
                I was born in Morristown, New Jersey and I spend my early childhood in Sayreville. I moved to Marlboro in two-thousand and six and have lived here since. 
                I moved to Hoboken for a year and a half and then moved back home due to Corona Virus. 
                <br>
                My undergraduate major is in Computer Engineering, however, I found out too late that the Computer Engineering curriculum is all over the place and the classes are really uninteresting.
                I found that the Computer Science classes are a lot more interesting so I did all my technical electives in the Computer Science Department.
