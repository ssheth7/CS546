    <h1> The Time I Broke My Arm</h1>
    <main>
      <article>
        My friends went skiing in Vermont and my parents forced me to go. We got started and two hours in I fell and broke both bones in my left arm. 
        I got my arm reset in the hospital and then we went back to New Jersey in a snow storm and I think we almost died. Once I got back I got my surgery within the week and
        then after 6 months of recovery and therapy, I got back to normal with 2 metal rods in my arm.
